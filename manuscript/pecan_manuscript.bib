abstract = {There is an explosion of interest in Bayesian statistics, primarily because recently created computational methods have finally made Bayesian analysis obtainable to a wide audience. Doing Bayesian Data Analysis, A Tutorial Introduction with R and BUGS provides an accessible approach to Bayesian data analysis, as material is explained clearly with concrete examples. The book begins with the basics, including essential concepts of probability and random sampling, and gradually progresses to advanced hierarchical modeling methods for realistic data. The text delivers comprehensive coverage of all scenarios addressed by non-Bayesian textbooks--t-tests, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and comparisons in ANOVA, multiple regression, and chi-square (contingency table analysis). This book is intended for first year graduate students or advanced undergraduates. It provides a bridge between undergraduate training and modern Bayesian methods for data analysis, which is becoming the accepted research standard. Prerequisite is knowledge of algebra and basic calculus.},

abstract = {Leaf based models of net photosynthesis (A<sub>n</sub>) and stomatal conductance (g) are often components of whole plant, canopy and regional models of net primary productivity and surface energy balance. Since C<sub>4</sub> metabolism shows unique responses to environmental conditions and C<sub>4</sub> species are important agriculturally and ecologically, a realistic and accurate leaf model specific to C<sub>4</sub> plants is needed. In this paper we develop a simple model for predicting A<sub>n</sub> and g from leaves of C<sub>4</sub> plants that is easily parameterised and that predicts many of the important environmental responses. <P></P> We derive the leaf model from a simple biochemical-intercellular transport model of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis that includes inorganic carbon fixation by PEP carboxylase, light dependent generation of PEP and RuBP, rubisco reaction kinetics, and the diffusion of inorganic carbon and O<sub>2</sub> between the bundle sheath and mesophyll. We argue that under most conditions these processes can be described simply as three potentially limiting steps. The leaf photosynthesis model treats A<sub>n</sub> as first order with respect to either light, CO<sub>2</sub> or the amount of rubisco present and produces a continuous transition between limitations. The independent variables of the leaf photosynthesis model are leaf temperature (T<sub>I</sub>), intercellular CO<sub>2</sub> levels and the absorbed quantum flux. <P></P> A simple linear model of g in terms of A<sub>n</sub> and leaf surface CO<sub>2</sub> level (p<sub>s</sub>) and relative humidity (h<sub>s</sub>) is combined with the photosynthesis model to give leaf photosynthesis as a function of absorbed quantum flux, T<sub>1</sub> and p<sub>s</sub> and h<sub>s</sub> levels. <P></P> Gas exchange measurements from corn leaves exposed to varied light, CO<sub>2</sub> and temperature levels are used to parameterise and test the models. Model parameters are determined by fitting the models to a set of 21 measurements. The behaviour of the models is compared with an independent set of 71 measurements, and the predictions are shown to be highly correlated with the data. <P></P> Under most conditions the leaf model can be parameterised simply by determining the level of rubisco in the leaves. The effects of light environment, nutritional status and water stress levels on A<sub>n</sub> and g can be accounted for by appropriate adjustment of the capacity for rubisco to fix CO<sub>2</sub>. We estimate rubsico capacity from CO<sub>2</sub> and light saturated photosynthesis although leaf nitrogen content or rubisco assays from leaf extracts could also be used for this purpose.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Meta-analysis is a set of statistical procedures for synthesizing research results from a number of different studies. An estimate of a statistical effect, such as the difference in disease severity for plants with or without a management treatment, is collected from each study along with a measure of the variance of the estimate of the effect. Combining results from different studies will generally result in increased statistical power so that it is easier to detect small effects. Combining results from different studies may also make it possible to compare the size of the effect as a function of other predictor variables such as geographic region or pathogen species. We present a review of the basic methodology for meta-analysis. We also present an example of meta-analysis of the relationship between disease severity and yield loss for foliar wheat diseases, based on data collected from a decade of fungicide and nematicide test results.},

abstract = {Most scientists conduct analyses and run models in several different software and hardware environments, mentally coordinating the export and import of data from one environment to another. The Kepler scientific workflow system provides domain scientists with an easy-to-use yet powerful system for capturing scientific workflows (SWFs). SWFs are a formalization of the ad-hoc process that a scientist may go through to get from raw data to publishable results. Kepler attempts to streamline the workflow creation and execution process so that scientists can design, execute, monitor, re-run, and communicate analytical procedures repeatedly with minimal effort. Kepler is unique in that it seamlessly combines high-level workflow design with execution and runtime interaction, access to local and remote data, and local and remote service invocation. SWFs are superficially similar to business process workflows but have several challenges not present in the business workflow scenario. For example, they often operate on large, complex and heterogeneous data, can be computationally intensive and produce complex derived data products that may be archived for use in reparameterized runs or other workflows. Moreover, unlike business workflows, SWFs are often dataflow-oriented as witnessed by a number of recent academic systems (e.g., DiscoveryNet, Taverna and Triana) and commercial systems (Scitegic/Pipeline-Pilot, Inforsense). In a sense, SWFs are often closer to signal-processing and data streaming applications than they are to control-oriented business workflow applications.},

@article{moore2008ets,
abstract = {Modeling how the role of forests in the carbon cycle will respond to predicted changes in water availability hinges on an understanding of the processes controlling water use in ecosystems. Recent studies in forest ecosystem modeling have employed data-assimilation techniques to generate parameter sets that conform to observations, and predict net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and its component processes. Since the carbon and water cycles are linked, there should be additional process information available from ecosystem H2O exchange. We coupled SIPNET (Simple Photosynthesis EvapoTranspiration), a simplified model of ecosystem function, with a data-assimilation system to estimate parameters leading to model predictions most closely matching the net CO2 and H2O fluxes measured by eddy covariance in a high-elevation, subalpine forest ecosystem. When optimized using measurements of CO2 exchange, the model matched observed NEE (RMSE = 0.49 g C m−2) but underestimated transpiration calculated independently from sap flow measurements by a factor of 4. Consequently, the carbon-only optimization was insensitive to imposed changes in water availability. Including eddy flux data from both CO2 and H2O exchange to the optimization reduced the model fit to the observed NEE fluxes only slightly (RME = 0.53 g C m−2), however this parameterization also reproduced transpiration calculated from independent sap flow measurements (r2 = 0.67, slope = 0.6). A significant amount of information can be extracted from simultaneous analysis of CO2 and H2O exchange, which improved the accuracy of transpiration estimates from measured evapotranspiration. Conversely, failure to include both CO2 and H2O data streams can generate results that mask the responses of ecosystem carbon cycling to variation in the precipitation. In applying the model conditioned on both CO2 and H2O fluxes to the subalpine forest at the Niwot Ridge AmeriFlux site, we observed that the onset of transpiration is coincident with warm soil temperatures. However, after snow has covered the ground in the fall, we observed significant inter-annual variability in the fraction of evapotranspiration composed of transpiration; evapotranspiration was dominated by transpiration in years when late fall air temperatures were high enough to maintain photosynthesis, but by sublimation from the surface of the snowpack in years when late fall air temperatures were colder and forest photosynthetic activity had ceased. Data-assimilation techniques and simultaneous measurements of carbon and water exchange can be used to quantify the response of net carbon uptake to changes in water availability by using an ecosystem model where the carbon and water cycles are linked.},

Jensen’s inequality is a mathematical proof that is seldom mentioned in the ecological literature but which provides a powerful tool for predicting some direct effects of environmental variance in biological systems. Qualitative predictions can be derived from the form of the relevant response functions (accelerating versus decelerating).

abstract = {We conducted an inverse modeling analysis, using a variety of data streams (tower-based eddy covariance measurements of net ecosystem exchange, NEE, of CO2, chamber-based measurements of soil respiration, and ancillary ecological measurements of leaf area index, litterfall, and woody biomass increment) to estimate parameters and initial carbon (C) stocks of a simple forest C-cycle model, DALEC, using Monte Carlo procedures. Our study site is the spruce-dominated Howland Forest AmeriFlux site, in central Maine, USA. Our analysis focuses on: (1) full characterization of data uncertainties, and treatment of these uncertainties in the parameter estimation; (2) evaluation of how combinations of different data streams influence posterior parameter distributions and model uncertainties; and (3) comparison of model performance (in terms of both predicted fluxes and pool dynamics) during a 4-year calibration period (1997-2000) and a 4-year validation period ("forward run", 2001-2004). We find that woody biomass increment, and, to a lesser degree, soil respiration, measurements contribute to marked reductions in uncertainties in parameter estimates and model predictions as these provide orthogonal constraints to the tower NEE measurements. However, none of the data are effective at constraining fine root or soil C pool dynamics, suggesting that these should be targets for future measurement efforts. A key finding is that adding additional constraints not only reduces uncertainties (i.e., narrower confidence intervals) on model predictions, but at the same time also results in improved model predictions by greatly reducing bias associated with predictions during the forward run.},

abstract = {Biophysical models intended for routine applications at a range of scales should attempt to balance the competing demands of generality and simplicity and be capable of realistically simulating the response of CO2 and energy ﬂuxes to environmental and physiological forcings. At the same time they must remain computationally inexpensive and sufﬁciently simple to be effectively parameterized at the scale of application. This study investigates the utility of twomodeling strategies for quantifying coupled land surface ﬂuxes of carbon and water, which differ distinctly in their description of CO2 assimilation processes. ‘Bottom-up’ models of land–atmosphere carbon exchange are based on detailed mechanistic descriptions of leaf-level photosynthetic processes scaled to the canopy whereas ‘top-down’ scaling approaches neglect the behavior of individual leaves and consider the canopy response to its environment in bulk. Effective intercomparisons of a light-use-efﬁciency (LUE)-based model of canopy conductance and a mechanistic model of leaf photosynthesis–stomatal response that employs a ‘twoleaf’ scaling strategy are facilitated by embedding both canopy sub-models in the Atmosphere–Land Exchange (ALEX) surface energy balance model.Water and carbon ﬂux simulations are evaluated across time scales of hours, days, seasons and years for a variety of natural and agricultural ecosystems, using micrometeorological data from several AmeriFlux sites across the U.S. While both modeling paradigms reproduced observedmagnitudes and variances of carbon andwater vapor exchange on hourly and daily timescales with acceptable accuracy, the simpler LUE-based model often performed better than the more detailed scaled-leaf model, which has many adjustable species-speciﬁc model parameters. Actual light-use efﬁciencies vary signiﬁcantly in response to changing environmental conditions and the success of LUE-based modeling frameworks rely on their ability to realistically respond to changes in light environment, atmospheric humidity, CO2 concentration and a desiccating environment},

abstract = {This paper has two main themes. First, the various statistical measures used in this journal are summarized and their interrelationships described by way of a flow chart. These are the pooled standard deviation, the pooled variance or mean square error (MSE), the standard error of each treatment mean (SEM) and of the difference between two treatment means (SED), and the least difference between two means which is significant at (e.g.) the 5\% level of significance (LSD(5\%)). The last three measures can be displayed as vertical bars in graphs, and the relationship between the lengths of these bars is graphically illustrated. It is suggested that the LSD is the most useful of these three measures. Second, when the experimenter has no prior hypotheses to be tested using analysis of variance "contrasts," a multiple comparison procedure (MCP) that examines all pair-wise differences between treatment means, may be appropriate. In this paper a fictitious experimental data set is used to compare several well-known McPs by focussing on a particular operating characteristic, the consistency of the results between an overall analysis of all treatments and an analysis of a subset of the experimental treatments. The procedure that behaves best according to this criterion is the unrestricted least significant difference (LSD) procedure. The unrestricted LSD is therefore recommended with the proviso that it be used as a method of generating hypotheses to be tested in subsequent experimentation, not as a method that attempts to simultaneously formulate and test hypotheses.},

abstract = {The convergent quantum yield hypothesis (CQY) assumes that thermodynamics and natural selection jointly limit variation in the maximum energetic efficiency of photosynthesis in low light under otherwise specified conditions (e.g. temperature and CO(2) concentration). A literature survey of photosynthetic quantum yield (phi) studies in terrestrial plants from C(3), C(4), and CAM photosynthetic types was conducted to test the CQY hypothesis. Broad variation in phi values from C(3) plants could partially be explained by accounting for whether the measuring conditions were permissive or restrictive for photorespiration. Assimilatory quotients (AQ), calculated from the CO(2) phi:O(2) phi ratios, indicated that 49\% and 29\% of absorbed light energy was allocated to carbon fixation and photorespiration in C(3) plants, respectively. The unexplained remainder (22\%) may represent diversion to various other energy-demanding processes (e.g. starch synthesis, nitrogen assimilation). Individual and cumulative effects of these other processes on photosynthetic efficiency are poorly quantified. In C(4) plants, little variation in phi values was observed, consistent with the fact that C(4) plants exhibit little photorespiration. As before, AQ values indicate that 22\% of absorbed light energy cannot be accounted for by carbon fixation in C(4) plants. Among all three photosynthetic types, the phi of photosynthesis in CAM plants is the least studied, appears to be highly variable, and may present the greatest challenge to the CQY hypothesis. The high amount of energy diverted to processes other than carbon fixation in C(3) and C(4) plants and the poor characterization of photosynthetic efficiency in CAM plants are significant deficiencies in our otherwise robust understanding of the energetics of terrestrial photoautotrophy.},

abstract = {It may be endemic to mechanistic modelling of complex environmental systems that there are many different model structures and many different parameter sets within a chosen model structure that may be behavioural or acceptable in reproducing the observed behaviour of that system. This has been called the equifinality concept. The generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) methodology for model identification allowing for equifinality is described. Prediction within this methodology is a process of ensemble forecasting using a sample of parameter sets from the behavioural model space, with each sample weighted according to its likelihood measure to estimate prediction quantiles. This allows that different models may contribute to the ensemble prediction interval at different time steps and that the distributional form of the predictions may change over time. Any effects of model nonlinearity, covariation of parameter values and errors in model structure, input data or observed variables, with which the simulations are compared, are handled implicitly within this procedure. GLUE involves a number of choices that must be made explicit and can be therefore subjected to scrutiny and discussion. These include ways of combining information from different types of model evaluation or from different periods in a data assimilation context. An example application to rainfall-runoff modelling is used to illustrate the methodology, including the updating of likelihood measures.},

abstract = {The ecosystem approach to ecology treats organisms and the physical elements of their environment as components of a single, integrated system. This comprehensive textbook outlines the central processes that characterize terrestrial ecosystems, tracing the flow of water, carbon, and nutrients from their abiotic origins to their cycles through plants, animals, and decomposer organisms. As human activity becomes an increasingly dominant factor in natural processes around the globe, landscape dynamics over time and space have become the focus of recent attention. This book synthesizes current advances in ecology with established theory to offer a complete survey of ecosystem pattern and process in the terrestrial environment. Featuring review questions at the end of each chapter, suggestions for recommended reading, and a glossary of ecological terms, Principles of Terrestrial Ecosystem Ecology will be an important text suitable for use in all courses on ecosystem ecology. Resource managers, land use managers, and researchers will also welcome its thorough presentation of ecosystem essentials. About the Authors F.

We examined the upper limits of acceptable MSDs as acceptance criterion in the case of normally distributed data. The implications of this approach are examined in terms of false negative rate as well as false positive rate. Results indicated that the proposed approach has reasonable statistical properties. Reproductive data from short-term chronic WET test with Ceriodaphnia dubia tests were used to demonstrate the applications of the proposed approach. The data were collected by the North Carolina Department of Environment, Health, and Natural Resources (Raleigh, NC, USA) as part of their National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program.},

This analysis provides global distributions for fine root biomass, length, and surface area with depth in the soil, and global estimates of nutrient pools in fine roots. Calculated root surface area is almost always greater than leaf area, more than an order of magnitude so in grasslands. The average C:N:P ratio in living fine roots is 450:11:1, and global fine root carbon is more than 5\% of all carbon contained in the atmosphere.

abstract = {Invasive species represent a select subset of organisms that have successfully transitioned through each stage of the introduction process (transportation, establishment, and spread). Although there is a growing realization that behavior plays a critical role in invasion success, few studies have focused on the initial stages of introduction. We examined whether differences in the grouping tendencies and exploratory behavior of two sympatric lizard species could contribute to their divergent invasion success. While the nondirected activity of the two species did not differ, the invasive delicate skink (Lampropholis delicata) was found to be more exploratory than the congeneric noninvasive garden skink (L. guichenoti), which enabled it to more effectively locate novel environments and basking site resources. The delicate skink also exhibited a greater tendency to hide, which may act to enhance its probability of ensnarement in freight and cargo and decrease its likelihood of detection during transit. The grouping tendencies of the two species did not differ. Together, our results suggest that while the two species have an equivalent "opportunity" for unintentional human-assisted transportation, several pre-existing behavioral traits may enhance the success of the delicate skink in negotiating the initial stages of the introduction process, and subsequent post-establishment spread.},

abstract = {Biofuels from crops are emerging as a Jekyll \& Hyde 2013 promoted by some as a means to offset fossil fuel emissions, denigrated by others as lacking sustainability and taking land from food crops. It is frequently asserted that plants convert only 0.1\% of solar energy into biomass, therefore requiring unacceptable amounts of land for production of fuel feedstocks. The C4 perennial grass Miscanthus×giganteus has proved a promising biomass crop in Europe, while switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) has been tested at several locations in N. America. Here, replicated side-by-side trials of these two crops were established for the first time along a latitudinal gradient in Illinois. Over 3 years of trials, Miscanthus×giganteus achieved average annual conversion efficiencies into harvestable biomass of 1.0\% (30 t ha22121) and a maximum of 2.0\% (61 t ha22121), with minimal agricultural inputs. The regionally adapted switchgrass variety Cave-in-Rock achieved somewhat lower yields, averaging 10 t ha22121. Given that there has been little attempt to improve the agronomy and genetics of these grasses compared with the major grain crops, these efficiencies are the minimum of what may be achieved. At this 1.0\% efficiency, 12 million hectares, or 9.3\% of current US cropland, would be sufficient to provide 133 × 109 L of ethanol, enough to offset one-fifth of the current US gasoline use. In contrast, maize grain from the same area of land would only provide 49 × 109 L, while requiring much higher nitrogen and fossil energy inputs in its cultivation.},

abstract = {Our central goal is to determine the importance of including both mean and variability changes in climate change scenarios in an agricultural context. By adapting and applying a stochastic weather generator, we first tested the sensitivity of the CERES-Wheat model to combinations of mean and variability changes of temperature and precipitation for two locations in Kansas. With a 2°C increase in temperature with daily (and interannual) variance doubled, yields were further reduced compared to the mean only change. In contrast, the negative effects of the mean temperature increase were greatly ameliorated by variance decreased by one-half. Changes for precipitation are more complex, since change in variability naturally attends change in mean, and constraining the stochastic generator to mean change only is highly artificial. The crop model is sensitive to precipitation variance increases with increased mean and variance decreases with decreased mean. With increased mean precipitation and a further increase in variability Topeka (where wheat cropping is not very moisture limited) experiences decrease in yield after an initial increase from the 'mean change only case. At Goodland Kansas, a moisture-limited site where summer fallowing is practiced, yields are decreased with decreased precipitation, but are further decreased when variability is further reduced. The range of mean and variability changes to which the crop model is sensitive are within the range of changes found in regional climate modeling (RegCM) experiments for a CO2 doubling (compared to a control run experiment). We then formed two types of climate change scenarios based on the changes in climate found in the control and doubled CO2 experiments over the conterminous U. S. of RegCM: (1) one using only mean monthly changes in temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation; and (2) another that included these mean changes plus changes in daily (and interannual) variability. The scenarios were then applied to the CERES-Wheat model at four locations (Goodland, Topeka, Des Moines, Spokane) in the United States. Contrasting model responses to the two scenarios were found at three of the four sites. At Goodland, and Des Moines mean climate change increased mean yields and decreased yield variability, but the mean plus variance climate change reduced yields to levels closer to their base (unchanged) condition. At Spokane mean climate change increased yields, which were somewhat further increased with climate variability change. Three key aspects that contribute to crop response are identified: the marginality of the current climate for crop growth, the relative size of the mean and variance changes, and timing of these changes. Indices for quantifying uncertainty in the impact assessment were developed based on the nature of the climate scenario formed, and the magnitude of difference between model and observed values of relevant climate variables.},

abstract = {Biomass accumulation of different grass species can be quantified by leaf area index (LAI) development, the Beer–Lambert light interception function, and a species-specific radiation-use efficiency (RUE). The object of this field study was to compare RUE values and leaf CO2 exchange rates (CER) for four C4 grasses. Biomass, LAI, and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) intercepted were measured during three growing seasons. CER was measured on several dates and at several positions in the canopies. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) had the greatest RUE whereas sideoats grama [Bouteloua curtipendula (Michaux) Torrey] had the lowest. Big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii Vitman) and eastern gamagrass [Tripsacum dactyloides (L.) L.] values were intermediate. The two species with the greatest differences in RUE, switchgrass and sideoats grama, had similar relative amounts partitioned to roots. Likewise differences among species in the accumulation of soil carbon showed trends similar to total shoot biomass production. The light extinction coefficients (k) of switchgrass, big bluestem, and eastern gamagrass were smaller than for sideoats grama, implying that light was more effectively scattered down into the leaf canopy of the first three grasses. Whole canopy CER values were calculated with a stratified canopy approach, using LAI values, the Beer–Lambert formula with appropriate extinction coefficients, and CER light response curves. Differences among species in RUE were similar to these values for estimated whole-canopy CER divided by the fraction of light that was intercepted. High LAI along with low k contributed to higher RUE in switchgrass, in spite of lower values for single-leaf CER.},

abstract = {Climatological surface wind speed probability density functions (PDFs) estimated from observations are characterized and used to evaluate, for the first time, contemporaneous wind PDFs predicted by a GCM. The observations include NASA’s global Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) dataset, the NCEP/ Department of Energy Global Reanalysis 2 (NCEP-2) 6-hourly reanalysis, and the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO)/Triangle Trans-Ocean Buoy Network (TRITON) moored buoy data, all from 2000 to 2005. Wind speed mean, 90th percentile, standard deviation, and Weibull shape parameter climatologies are constructed from these data. New features that emerge from the analysis include the identification of a stationary pattern to the wind speed variance in the equatorial Pacific. Interestingly, a distinct wind speed shape anomaly migrates with the ITCZ across this stationary background. The GCM despite its coarser spatial and temporal resolution predicts wind speed PDFs in general agreement with observations. Relative to QuikSCAT, the NCAR Community Atmosphere Model, version 3 (CAM3) GCM has a globally averaged positive mean wind speed bias of about 0.2 m s �1 originating primarily within the trades and Southern Hemisphere storm track. Global standard deviation biases are largest in the winter hemisphere storm tracks. The largest shape biases occur along the equatorial peripheries},

abstract = {Scale separation crossing many orders of magnitude is a consistent challenge in the ecological sciences. Wind dispersal of seed that generates plant propagation fronts is a typical case where timescales range from less than a second for fast turbulent processes to interannual timescales governing plant growth and climatic forcing. We show that the scale separation can be overcome by developing mechanistic and statistical links between processes at the different timescales. A mechanistic model is used to scale up from the turbulent regime to hourly timescales, while a superstatistical approach is used to relate the half-hourly timescales to annual vegetation migration speeds. We derive a semianalytical model to predict vegetation front movement as a function of wind-forcing statistics and characteristics of the species being dispersed. This model achieves better than order-of-magnitude agreement in a case study of tree dispersal from the early Holocene, a marked improvement over diffusion models. Plant migration is shown to depend nonlinearly on the wind environment forcing the movement but linearly on most physiological parameters. Applications of these analytical results to parameterizing models of plant dispersion and the implications of the superstatistical approach for addressing other ecological problems plagued by similar "dimensionality curses" are outlined.},

abstract = {Our meta-analysis of 126 nitrogen addition experiments evaluated nitrogen (N) limitation of net primary production (NPP) in terrestrial ecosystems. We tested the hypothesis that N limitation is widespread among biomes and influenced by geography and climate. We used the response ratio (R approximately equal ANPP(N)/ANPP(ctrl)) of aboveground plant growth in fertilized to control plots and found that most ecosystems are nitrogen limited with an average 29\% growth response to nitrogen (i.e., R = 1.29). The response ratio was significant within temperate forests (R = 1.19), tropical forests (R = 1.60), temperate grasslands (R = 1.53), tropical grasslands (R = 1.26), wetlands (R = 1.16), and tundra (R = 1.35), but not deserts. Eight tropical forest studies had been conducted on very young volcanic soils in Hawaii, and this subgroup was strongly N limited (R = 2.13), which resulted in a negative correlation between forest R and latitude. The degree of N limitation in the remainder of the tropical forest studies (R = 1.20) was comparable to that of temperate forests, and when the young Hawaiian subgroup was excluded, forest R did not vary with latitude. Grassland response increased with latitude, but was independent of temperature and precipitation. These results suggest that the global N and C cycles interact strongly and that geography can mediate ecosystem response to N within certain biome types.},

abstract = {Wind can be regarded as the most important vector for seed dispersal in open grassland vegetation. Experimental estimates of seed dispersal distances in this environment are complex because of low arrival probabilities at large distances. Therefore, a proper mathematical generalization would be essential to give insight in dispersal probability distributions. Hence a promising individual-based model for seed dispersal presented by Andersen was tested for different wind velocities and seeds. Simulation results from the seed dispersal model were compared with observations in a horizontal wind tunnel. Considering the large variation in seed morphology and mass, the simulation results fitted wind tunnel results reasonably well, indicating the general applicability of the tested model for herbaceous species. Model sensitivity was evaluated with respect to wind speed and vegetation height. Differences in wind speed had a larger impact on the tail of the seed shadow than on median dispersal. However, vegetation height had little impact on the tail of the seed shadow compared to the median. Terminal velocity (Vt) is the crucial species specific parameter in wind dispersal models. There are two frequently used methods to determine Vt: a dropping method and a method to float seeds in an upward air stream. However, these methods have never been compared directly. This paper presents Vt values determined with both methods. In general results were in the same order. Only for high values of Vt the results of the floating method were found to be lower than the results of the dropping method. Simulation results showed that the intraspecific differences in Vt values were an important factor in determining the seed shadow.},

abstract = {Bringing together leaf trait data spanning 2,548 species and 175 sites we describe, for the first time at global scale, a universal spectrum of leaf economics consisting of key chemical, structural and physiological properties. The spectrum runs from quick to slow return on investments of nutrients and dry mass in leaves, and operates largely independently of growth form, plant functional type or biome. Categories along the spectrum would, in general, describe leaf economic variation at the global scale better than plant functional types, because functional types overlap substantially in their leaf traits. Overall, modulation of leaf traits and trait relationships by climate is surprisingly modest, although some striking and significant patterns can be seen. Reliable quantification of the leaf economics spectrum and its interaction with climate will prove valuable for modelling nutrient fluxes and vegetation boundaries under changing land-use and climate.},

abstract = {Here, we tested hypothesized relationships among leaf and fine root traits of grass, forb, legume, and woody plant species of a savannah community. CO2 exchange rates, structural traits, chemistry, and longevity were measured in tissues of 39 species grown in long-term monocultures. Across species, respiration rates of leaves and fine roots exhibited a common regression relationship with tissue nitrogen (N) concentration, although legumes had lower rates at comparable N concentrations. Respiration rates and N concentration declined with increasing longevity of leaves and roots. Species rankings of leaf and fine-root N and longevity were correlated, but not specific leaf area and specific root length. The C3 and C4 grasses had lower N concentrations than forbs and legumes, but higher photosynthesis rates across a similar range of leaf N. Despite contrasting photosynthetic pathways and N2-fixing ability among these species, concordance in above- and below-ground traits was evident in comparable rankings in leaf and root longevity, N and respiration rates, which is evidence of a common leaf and root trait syndrome linking traits to effects on plant and ecosystem processes.},

abstract = {This study examines the effect of differential survival of seedlings on the distribution of native grasses along topographic gradients in the Nebraska Sandhills. In 1981, seeds of three ridge species (Andropogon hallii, Sorghastrum nutans, Panicum virgatum) were planted into rototilled, irrigated, rototilled and irrigated, or untreated soils on three sites: one ridge site (ridge) and two valley sites (valley and lowland). The three sites represented a gradient of topography and soil moisture-holding capacity. For all species, seedling survival was greatest (86\%) in the rototilled and irrigated treatment on the lowland site. No seedlings survived in untreated plots along the gradient. In 1982 and 1983, seeds of a ridge species (Andropogon hallii) and a valley species (Bouteloua gracilis) were planted in replicated ridge and valley plots. Seeds were planted into either untreated plots, or plots where plants received weekly clipping treatments around seedlings. Although clipping significantly increased survival of both species in both sites, it had a significantly greater effect in valley sites. In untreated plots, seedling survival was greatest (20\%) in ridge sites in a year of average precipitation (1982) and in valley sites (49\%) in a year that was exceptionally wet (1983). In 1983, soil moisture explained 98\% of the variation in the survival of A. hallii seedlings and 82\% in B. gracilis seedlings. Competition from existing vegetation severely limited the probability of seedling establishment. The distribution pattern of ridge species likely results from differential survival of juveniles and adults along the gradient, rather than the ability of seedlings to have higher establishment success on ridge sites. Significant establishment of the valley species (Bouteloua gracilis) occurred only during an exceptionally wet year when the pattern of survival of seedlings reflected the distribution pattern of adult plants. Establishment of prairie grass seedlings appears to depend on the availability of soil moisture, which may only be adequate in relatively large disturbance areas (>1 m2), or in years of higher than normal precipitation.},

@article{williams2005iaf,
abstract = {There are two broad approaches to quantifying landscape C dynamics – by measuring changes in C stocks over time, or by measuring fluxes of C directly. However, these data may be patchy, and have gaps or biases. An alternative approach to generating C budgets has been to use process-based models, constructed to simulate the key processes involved in C exchange. However, the process of model building is arguably subjective, and parameters may be poorly defined. This paper demonstrates why data assimilation (DA) techniques – which combine stock and flux observations with a dynamic model – improve estimates of, and provide insights into, ecosystem carbon (C) exchanges. We use an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to link a series of measurements with a simple box model of C transformations. Measurements were collected at a young ponderosa pine stand in central Oregon over a 3-year period, and include eddy flux and soil CO2 efflux data, litterfall collections, stem surveys, root and soil cores, and leaf area index data. The simple C model is a mass balance model with nine unknown parameters, tracking changes in C storage among five pools; foliar, wood and fine root pools in vegetation, and also fresh litter and soil organic matter (SOM) plus coarse woody debris pools. We nested the EnKF within an optimization routine to generate estimates from the data of the unknown parameters and the five initial conditions for the pools. The efficacy of the DA process can be judged by comparing the probability distributions of estimates produced with the EnKF analysis vs. those produced with reduced data or model alone. Using the model alone, estimated net ecosystem exchange of C (NEE)=−251±197 g C m−2 over the 3 years, compared with an estimate of −419±29 g C m−2 when all observations were assimilated into the model. The uncertainty on daily measurements of NEE via eddy fluxes was estimated at 0.5 g C m−2 day−1, but the uncertainty on assimilated estimates averaged 0.47 g C m−2 day−1, and only exceeded 0.5 g C m−2 day−1 on days where neither eddy flux nor soil efflux data were available. In generating C budgets, the assimilation process reduced the uncertainties associated with using data or model alone and the forecasts of NEE were statistically unbiased estimates. The results of the analysis emphasize the importance of time series as constraints. Occasional, rare measurements of stocks have limited use in constraining the estimates of other components of the C cycle. Long time series are particularly crucial for improving the analysis of pools with long time constants, such as SOM, woody biomass, and woody debris. Long-running forest stem surveys, and tree ring data, offer a rich resource that could be assimilated to provide an important constraint on C cycling of slow pools. For extending estimates of NEE across regions, DA can play a further important role, by assimilating remote-sensing data into the analysis of C cycles. We show, via sensitivity analysis, how assimilating an estimate of photosynthesis – which might be provided indirectly by remotely sensed data – improves the analysis of NEE.},

abstract = {Biomass partitioning is an important variable in terrestrial ecosystem carbon modeling. However, geographical and interannual variability in f(BNPP), defined as the fraction of belowground net primary productivity (BNPP) to total NPP, and its relationship with climatic variables, have not been explored. Here we addressed these issues by synthesizing 94 site-year field biomass data at 12 grassland sites around the world from a global NPP database and from the literature. Results showed that f(BNPP) varied from 0.40 to 0.86 across 12 sites. In general, savanna and humid savanna ecosystems had smaller f(BNPP) but larger interannual variability in f(BNPP), and cold desert steppes had larger f(BNPP) but smaller interannual variability. While mean f(BNPP) at a site decreased significantly with increasing mean annual temperature and precipitation across sites, no consistent temporal response of f(BNPP) with annual temperature and precipitation was found within sites. Based on these results, both geographical variability in f(BNPP) and the divergent responses of f(BNPP) with climatic variables at geographical and temporal scales should be considered in global C modeling.},

abstract = {Expert knowledge in ecology is gaining momentum as a tool for conservation decision-making where data are lacking. Yet, little information is available to help a researcher decide whether expert opinion is useful for their model, how an elicitation should be conducted, what the most relevant method for elicitation is and how this can be translated into prior distributions for analysis in a Bayesian model. In this study, we provide guidance in using expert knowledge in a transparent and credible manner to inform ecological models and ultimately natural resource and conservation decision-making. We illustrate the decisions faced when considering the use of expert knowledge in a model with the help of two real ecological case studies. These examples are explored further to examine the impact of expert knowledge through ‘priors’ in Bayesian modeling and specifically how to minimize potential bias. Finally, we make recommendations on the use of expert opinion in ecology. We believe if expert knowledge is elicited and incorporated into ecological models with the same level of rigour provided in the collection and use of empirical data, expert knowledge can increase the precision of models and facilitate informed decision-making in a cost-effective manner.},

abstract = {Accurately predicting plant function and global biogeochemical cycles later in this century will be complicated if stomatal conductance (g(s)) acclimates to growth at elevated [CO(2)], in the sense of a long-term alteration of the response of g(s) to [CO(2)], humidity (h) and/or photosynthetic rate (A). If so, photosynthetic and stomatal models will require parameterization at each growth [CO(2)] of interest. Photosynthetic acclimation to long-term growth at elevated [CO(2)] occurs frequently. Acclimation of g(s) has rarely been examined, even though stomatal density commonly changes with growth [CO(2)]. Soybean was grown under field conditions at ambient [CO(2)] (378 micromol mol(-1)) and elevated [CO(2)] (552 micromol mol(-1)) using free-air [CO(2)] enrichment (FACE). This study tested for stomatal acclimation by parameterizing and validating the widely used Ball et al. model (1987, Progress in Photosynthesis Research, vol IV, 221-224) with measurements of leaf gas exchange. The dependence of g(s) on A, h and [CO(2)] at the leaf surface was unaltered by long-term growth at elevated [CO(2)]. This suggests that the commonly observed decrease in g(s) under elevated [CO(2)] is due entirely to the direct instantaneous effect of [CO(2)] on g(s) and that there is no longer-term acclimation of g(s) independent of photosynthetic acclimation. The model accurately predicted g(s) for soybean growing under ambient and elevated [CO(2)] in the field. Model parameters under ambient and elevated [CO(2)] were indistinguishable, demonstrating that stomatal function under ambient and elevated [CO(2)] could be modelled without the need for parameterization at each growth [CO(2)].},

As such, forest simulators are on the more complex end of ecological models, both because of the inherent complexity of forest communities and because these models are typically focused on predicting real assemblages of trees, not abstract “forest vegetation.” Diverse motivations have driven the development of forest simulators, but the objectives fall into two general classes: (1) to test and extend ecological theory and (2) to predict responses to management action and environmental change. Increasing scientiﬁc concern with climate change and the role of forests in global C and N cycles, together with advances in computational power and modeling, are increasing the importance of forest simulators as predictors of forest responses.},

abstract = {Several forces are converging to transform ecological research and increase its emphasis on quantitative forecasting. These forces include (1) dramatically increased volumes of data from observational and experimental networks, (2) increases in computational power, (3) advances in ecological models and related statistical and optimization methodologies, and most importantly, (4) societal needs to develop better strategies for natural resource management in a world of ongoing global change. Traditionally, ecological forecasting has been based on process-oriented models, informed by data in largely ad hoc ways. Although most ecological models incorporate some representation of mechanistic processes, today's models are generally not adequate to quantify real-world dynamics and provide reliable forecasts with accompanying estimates of uncertainty. A key tool to improve ecological forecasting and estimates of uncertainty is data assimilation (DA), which uses data to inform initial conditions and model parameters, thereby constraining a model during simulation to yield results that approximate reality as closely as possible. This paper discusses the meaning and history of DA in ecological research and highlights its role in refining inference and generating forecasts. DA can advance ecological forecasting by (1) improving estimates of model parameters and state variables, (2) facilitating selection of alternative model structures, and (3) quantifying uncertainties arising from observations, models, and their interactions. However, DA may not improve forecasts when ecological processes are not well understood or never observed. Overall, we suggest that DA is a key technique for converting raw data into ecologically meaningful products, which is especially important in this era of dramatically increased availability of data from observational and experimental networks.},

abstract = {Forests are one of Earth's critical biomes. They have been shown to respond strongly to many of the drivers that are predicted to change natural systems over this century, including climate, introduced species, and other anthropogenic influences. Predicting how different tree species might respond to this complex of forces remains a daunting challenge for forest ecologists. Yet shifts in species composition and abundance can radically influence hydrological and atmospheric systems, plant and animal ranges, and human populations, making this challenge an important one to address. Forest ecologists have gathered a great deal of data over the past decades and are now using novel quantitative and computational tools to translate those data into predictions about the fate of forests. Here, after a brief review of the threats to forests over the next century, one of the more promising approaches to making ecological predictions is described: using hierarchical Bayesian methods to model forest demography and simulating future forests from those models. This approach captures complex processes, such as seed dispersal and mortality, and incorporates uncertainty due to unknown mechanisms, data problems, and parameter uncertainty. After describing the approach, an example by simulating drought for a southeastern forest is offered. Finally, there is a discussion of how this approach and others need to be cast within a framework of prediction that strives to answer the important questions posed to environmental scientists, but does so with a respect for the challenges inherent in predicting the future of a complex biological system.},

abstract = {C(4)-type photosynthesis is known to vary with growth and measurement temperatures. In an attempt to quantify its variability with measurement temperature, the photosynthetic parameters - the maximum catalytic rate of the enzyme ribulose 1.5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) (V(cmax)), the maximum catalytic rate of the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) (V(pmax)) and the maximum electron transport rate (J(max)) - were examined. Maize plants were grown in climatic-controlled phytotrons, and the curves of net photosynthesis (A(n)) versus intercellular air space CO(2) concentrations (C(i)), and A(n) versus photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) were determined over a temperature range of 15-40 degrees C. Values of V(cmax), V(pmax) and J(max) were computed by inversion of the von Caemmerer \& Furbank photosynthesis model. Values of V(pmax) and J(max) obtained at 25 degrees C conform to values found in the literature. Parameters for an Arrhenius equation that best fits the calculated values of V(cmax), V(pmax) and J(max) are then proposed. These parameters should be further tested with C(4) plants for validation. Other model key parameters such as the mesophyll cell conductance to CO(2) (g(i)), the bundle sheath cells conductance to CO(2) (g(bs)) and Michaelis-Menten constants for CO(2) and O(2) (K(c), K(p) and K(o)) also vary with temperature and should be better parameterized.},

abstract = {We assess the significance of high-frequency variability of environmental parameters (sunlight, precipitation, temperature) for the structure and function of terrestrial ecosystems under current and future climate. We examine the influence of hourly, daily, and monthly variance using the Ecosystem Demography model version 2 in conjunction with the long-term record of carbon fluxes measured at Harvard Forest. We find that fluctuations of sunlight and precipitation are strongly and nonlinearly coupled to ecosystem function, with effects that accumulate through annual and decadal timescales. Increasing variability in sunlight and precipitation leads to lower rates of carbon sequestration and favors broad-leaved deciduous trees over conifers. Temperature variability has only minor impacts by comparison. We also find that projected changes in sunlight and precipitation variability have important implications for carbon storage and ecosystem structure and composition. Based on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change model estimates for changes in high-frequency meteorological variability over the next 100 years, we expect that terrestrial ecosystems will be affected by changes in variability almost as much as by changes in mean climate. We conclude that terrestrial ecosystems are highly sensitive to high-frequency meteorological variability, and that accurate knowledge of the statistics of this variability is essential for realistic predictions of ecosystem structure and functioning.},

Recently, there has been a new emphasis on intraspecific variability. Indeed, recent developments in trait-based community ecology have underlined the need to integrate variation at both the intraspecific as well as interspecific level. We introduce new T-statistics ('T' for trait), based on the comparison of intraspecific and interspecific variances of functional traits across organizational levels, to operationally incorporate intraspecific variability into community ecology theory. We show that a focus on the distribution of traits at local and regional scales combined with original analytical tools can provide unique insights into the primary forces structuring communities.},

This study examined genotypic variation in switchgrass transpiration efficiency (TE), defined as the weight of dry matter per unit of water transpired, under conditions of water and N stress. Since reports show TE to be correlated with specific leaf weight (SLW) and leaf ash, these easily measured traits were assessed for their potential as predictors of switchgrass TE. In one greenhouse experiment with nine cultivars and two outdoor experiments with two cultivars, plants were grown in closed containers in a soil–peat mix or solution culture and subjected to water or N deficit. Cultivars differed in TE; however, TE did not differ between water stressed and well-watered conditions. With decreasing N in solution, TE also decreased. Cultivars differed in their values of TE when grown in nutrient solutions containing 10.0 and 1.0 mM N, but not at 0.3 mM N. Transpiration efficiency was positively correlated with SLW in each experiment and across all experiments.},

abstract = {A global data set including 5,087 observations of leaf nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) for 1,280 plant species at 452 sites and of associated mean climate indices demonstrates broad biogeographic patterns. In general, leaf N and P decline and the N/P ratio increases toward the equator as average temperature and growing season length increase. These patterns are similar for five dominant plant groups, coniferous trees and four angiosperm groups (grasses, herbs, shrubs, and trees). These results support the hypotheses that (i) leaf N and P increase from the tropics to the cooler and drier midlatitudes because of temperature-related plant physiological stoichiometry and biogeographical gradients in soil substrate age and then plateau or decrease at high latitudes because of cold temperature effects on biogeochemistry and (ii) the N/P ratio increases with mean temperature and toward the equator, because P is a major limiting nutrient in older tropical soils and N is the major limiting nutrient in younger temperate and high-latitude soils.},

abstract = {The Weibull function is discussed for representation of the wind speed frequency distribution. Methods are presented for estimating the two Weibull parameters (scale factor c and shape factor k) from simple wind statistics. Comparison is made with a recently proposed method based on the “square-root-normal” distribution with mean wind speed and fastest mile data as input statistics. The Weibull distribution is shown to give smaller root-mean-square errors than the square-root-normal distribution when fitting actual distributions of observed wind speed. Another advantage of the Weibull distribution is the available methodology for projecting to another height the observed Weibull distribution parameters at anemometer height.},

@article{clark1999sdn,
abstract = {Dispersal affects community dynamics and vegetation response to global change. Understanding these effects requires descriptions of dispersal at local and regional scales and statistical models that permit estimation. Classical models of dispersal describe local or long-distance dispersal, but not both. The lack of statistical methods means that models have rarely been fitted to seed dispersal in closed forests. We present a mixture model of dispersal that assumes a range of disperal patterns, both local and long distance. The bivariate Student's t or "2Dt" follows from an assumption that the distance parameter in a Gaussian model varies randomly, thus having a density of its own. We use an inverse approach to "compete" our mixture model against classical alternatives, using seed rain databases from temperate broadleaf, temperate mixed-conifer, and tropical floodplain forests. For most species, the 2Dt model fits dispersal data better than do classical models, The superior fit results from the potential for a convex shape near the source tree and a "fat tail." Our parameter estimates have implications for community dynamics at local scales, for vegetation responses to global change at regional scales, and for differences in seed dispersal among biomes. The 2Dt model predicts that less seed travels beyond the immediate crown influence (30 m). Although Gaussian and exponential models predict slow population spread in the face of environmental change, our dispersal estimates suggest rapid spread. The preponderance of animal-dispersed and rare seed types in tropical forests results in noisier patterns of dispersal than occur in temperate hardwood and conifer stands.},
