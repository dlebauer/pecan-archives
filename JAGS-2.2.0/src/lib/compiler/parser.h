    We can't put any C++ class that requires a constructor in
    union. In particular, we can't have strings.  To get round this
    limitation, we put a pointer to a string in the union, and then
    get the lexical analyzer to return a pointer to a dynamically
    allocated string.  The parser frees the memory when it is done.
    This is tedious, but the alternative is to copy character
    arrays using, e.g. strncpy instead.
